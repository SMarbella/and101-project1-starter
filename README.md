## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The challenge encountered while building the app is that I had to learn a new programming language. Since I did not learn Kotlin before, it took me time to understand it and the ways the basics of Kotlin work. Another challenge I had to face was to add buttons with image icons. It took me a while to figure out how to create a working image button that sends a toast when the user taps on it. After I figured it out, I added more buttons to expand the app and improve the UI.
